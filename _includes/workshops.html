    <small>(*) Workshops available to training pass holders only.</small>

    <h3 class="center">R Package Development</h3>
    <!-- <h5 class="center">Sub-title</h5> -->
    <h4>Heather Turner</h4>

    <p>Curious about package development but not sure where to start? This workshop is for you! The goal is to empower you to contribute back to the R ecosystem through writing your own packages or contributing to others. We’ll be using materials developed by Hadley Wickham, Jenny Bryan, and others on the <a href="https://forwards.github.io/about/">Forwards teaching team</a>.</p>

    <p>By the end of this workshop, you should know how to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>turn your code into an R package,</li>
        <li>use GitHub as an effective collaboration tool,</li>
        <li>add a vignette or an article,</li>
        <li>build a web page for your package, and</li>
        <li>submit a package to CRAN.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Prerequisites: Participants should know how to write functions in R. Knowledge of <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/index.html">R markdown</a> will be beneficial.</p>
    
    <p>Computing requirements: Attendees are encouraged to set up the required tools on their laptops as described <a href="https://github.com/forwards/workshops/blob/master/Computing_requirements.md">here</a>. Alternatively, an RStudio cloud with the required tools will be accessible for the duration of the workshop.</p>
    
    <p>Participants may bring their own code that they want to make into a package, or work with the example provided.</p>


    <h3 class="center">Building Successful Shiny Apps with {golem}</h3>
    <!-- <h5 class="center">Sub-title</h5> -->
    <h4>Colin Fay</h4>

    <p>Shiny is an amazing tool when it comes to creating web applications with R. Building a proof-of-concept application is easy, but things change when the application becomes larger and more complex, and especially when it comes to sending that app to production—until recently there hasn't been any real framework for building and deploying production-grade Shiny Apps. This is where {golem} comes into play: offering Shiny developers an opinionated framework for creating production-ready Shiny Applications.</p> 

    <p>With {golem}, Shiny developers now have a toolkit for making a stable, easy-to-maintain, and robust for production web application with R. {golem} has been developed to abstract away the most common engineering tasks (for example, module creation, addition of external CSS or JavaScript file, ...), so you can focus on what matters: building the application. And once your application is ready to be deployed, {golem} guides you through testing, and brings you tool for deploying to common platforms.</p>
        
    <p>In this workshop, attendees will be introduced to the {golem} package, then guided through the full development of a shiny app, from start to deployment!</p>
        
    <p>Attendees are expected to be already familiar with Shiny. Knowledge about package development is better but not compulsory.</p>

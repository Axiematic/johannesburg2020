    <h3 class="center">R Package Development</h3>
    <!-- <h5 class="center">Sub-title</h5> -->
    <h4>Heather Turner</h4>

    <p>Curious about package development but not sure where to start? This workshop is for you! The goal is to empower you to contribute back to the R ecosystem through writing your own packages or contributing to others. Weâ€™ll be using materials developed by Hadley Wickham, Jenny Bryan, and others on the <a href="https://forwards.github.io/about/">Forwards teaching team</a>.</p>

    <p>By the end of this workshop, you should know how to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>turn your code into an R package,</li>
        <li>use GitHub as an effective collaboration tool,</li>
        <li>add a vignette or an article,</li>
        <li>build a web page for your package, and</li>
        <li>submit a package to CRAN.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Prerequisites: Participants should know how to write functions in R. Knowledge of <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/index.html">R markdown</a> will be beneficial.</p>
    
    <p>Computing requirements: Attendees are encouraged to set up the required tools on their laptops as described <a href="https://github.com/forwards/workshops/blob/master/Computing_requirements.md">here</a>. Alternatively, an RStudio cloud with the required tools will be accessible for the duration of the workshop.</p>
    
    <p>Participants may bring their own code that they want to make into a package, or work with the example provided.</p>

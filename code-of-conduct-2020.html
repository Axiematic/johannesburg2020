<h1 align="center"> satRday Code of Conduct</h1>

<h2>Medium Version</h2>

<p>satRday is dedicated to providing a harassment-free and inclusive conference experience for all in attendance regardless of, but not limited to, gender, gender expression, sexual orientation, employment, disabilities, physical attributes, age, ethnicity, social standing, religion (or lack thereof) or political affiliation. We do not tolerate harassment of participants (including organisers and vendors) in any form. Sexual innuendos and imagery are not appropriate for any conference venue, including presentations.</p>
 
<p>Please note, all in attendance of satRday, including guests, organisers, sponsors, volunteers and exhibitors in the expo hall or vendor booths are also subject to the code of conduct and from here on shall be referred to as "participants".</p>

<h2>Long Version</h2>

<p>This code of conduct applies to all satRday's spaces both online and offline. Our events are intended to be accessible and welcoming to a diverse audience. We prioritise low-cost access to great information and we do our best to ensure our events support learning in a safe environment.</p>

<p>Please note, all in attendance of satRday, including guests, organisers, sponsors, volunteers and exhibitors in the expo hall or vendor booths are also subject to the code of conduct and from here on shall be referred to as "participants".</p>

<p>satRday is dedicated to providing a harassment-free and inclusive conference experience for all in attendance regardless of, but not limited to, gender, gender expression, sexual orientation, employment, disabilities, physical attributes, age, ethnicity, social standing, religion (or lack thereof) or political affiliation. Harassment of conference participants in any form will not  be tolerated. Sexual innuendos and imagery are deemed inappropriate for any conference activities.</p>
 
<p>Violation of these rules may result in expulsion from the conference (without a refund, when relevant) at the discretion of the conference organisers.</p>


<p>satRday attendants agree to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Be considerate in speech and actions, and actively seek to acknowledge and respect the boundaries of fellow attendees.</li>
	<li>Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behaviour and speech. Harassment includes, but is not limited to:</li>

		<ul>
			<li>Discrimination based on any of the above personal attributes.</li>
		 	<li>Sexual or discriminatory images in public spaces.</li>
			<li>Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following.</li>
			<li>Harassing photography or recording.</li>
			<li>Serious disruptions of presentations.</li>
			<li>Inappropriate physical contact.</li>
			<li>Offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race or religion.</li>
			<li>Unwelcome sexual attention.</li>
			<li>A pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others.</li>
			<li>Advocating or encouraging any of the above behaviours during any point of the satRday event.</li>
			<li>Threats of violence.</li>
		</ul>
</ul>
	
<p>satRday prioritises marginalised people's safety over privileged people's comfort. Consequently, the organisers will not act on complaints regarding:</p>

<ul>	
	<li> Reversisms including "reverse racism" and "reverse sexism".</li>
	<li> Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as "leave me alone", "go away" or "I'm not discussing this with you".</li>
	<li>Communicating in a tone you don't find congenial.</li>
	<li>Criticising racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behaviour or assumptions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Requirements for talks</h3>

<p>Talk slides should not contain offensive or sexualised material. If this material is impossible to avoid given the topic (for example text mining of material from hate sites) the existence of this material should be noted both in the abstract and at the start of the talk.</p>

<h3>Pre-Event Concerns</h3>

<p>If you are planning to attend satRday and have concerns regarding another individual who may be present, please contact a member of the planning committee (see below for contact information). Precautions will be taken to ensure a victim's comfort and safety, including, but not limited to; providing an escort, prepping onsite event staff, keeping victim and harasser from attending the same talks/social events, and providing onsite contact cell phone numbers for immediate contact. In extreme cases, we may take action to prevent the harasser from attending the conference.</p>

<h3>Enforcement</h3>

<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately. Presenters, sponsors and vendors should not use sexualised images or language. If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, event organisers retain the right to take action to keep the event a welcoming environment for all involved. This includes warning the offender or expulsion.</p>

<p>Event organisers may take action to redress anything disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any participants. We expect participants to follow these rules at all times.</p>

<h3>Reporting</h3>

<p>Harassment or other violation of the code of conduct reduces the value and enjoyment of our event for everyone.</p>

<p>If you or anyone else is made to feel unsafe, unwelcome or disrespected, please report this to a conference staff member as soon as possible. Reports can be made personally or anonymously (see below).</p>

<p>Information to include in a written anonymous or personal report (ie. to the relevant event <a href="#personnel">personnel</a>.)</p>

<ul>
	<li>Identifying information of victim and perpetrator.</li>
	<li>Actions deemed in violation of the Code of conduct.</li>
	<li>Approximate time of the violation.</li>
	<li>Surrounding circumstances of incident.</li>
	<li>Your identity (unless you wish to remain anonymous).</li>
	<li>Identifying information of other parties involved (eg. fellow eye witness).</li>
</ul>


<h4>Anonymous Report</h4>

<p>If you are being harassed, have seen or heard of another participant being harassed or have any other related queries please contact the following conference personnel:</p>

<ul id="personnel">
	<li>Emma Collier: 073 805 7439</li>
</ul>

<p>Alternatively, you can <a href="mailto:satrday.joburg+code-of-conduct@gmail.com?subject=Anonymous">email</a> the staff.<p>

<h4>Personal Report</h4>

<p>Personal reports can be made by contacting a nearby staff member.</p>

<p>During the reporting process, our staff will ensure you are safe and cannot be heard. Another member of staff may occasionally be necessary to ensure the report is dealt with correctly. Once safe, we'll ask you to tell us what happened. We understand this may be upsetting and assure you we will deal with it as respectfully as possible. You also will not be required to confront the perpetrator and your identity will not be shared with them either.</p>

</p>If you still feel threatened our team members will be more than happy to help you contact venue security or local law enforcement or otherwise assist you to feel safe for the remainder of the event. We value your participation and your security is of great importance.</p>

<p>This code of conduct applies to satRday's spaces, but if you are being harassed outside our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment seriously. The satRday Team reserves the right to exclude people from future satRday events based on their past behaviour at relevant events.</p>

<p>At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we've received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of satRday's members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.</p>

<p>Consult with other staff members regarding incidents when possible but also act when necessary.<p>
